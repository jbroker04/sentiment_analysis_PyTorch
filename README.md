**Sentiment Analysis using PyTorch and Transformers**
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using the powerful pre-trained transformer model BERT from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The code leverages PyTorch for efficient model training and evaluation.

**About PyTorch and BERT**
--------------------------
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research Lab (FAIR). It provides a dynamic computation graph and is well-suited for rapid prototyping and research. PyTorch is widely used for building and training neural networks, including transformer-based models like BERT.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model developed by Google in 2018. It is a deep learning model trained on a large corpus of text data to learn high-level semantic and syntactic features. BERT is based on the transformer architecture, which is well-suited for natural language processing tasks.

**Requirements**
----------------
* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.7+
* Transformers 4.0+
* Datasets 1.6+
* Matplotlib 3.3+
* NumPy 1.19+
* Torchtext 0.8+
* TQDM 4.56+

**Model Architecture**
----------------------
The project uses a transformer-based architecture for sentiment analysis. The model consists of a pre-trained language model BERT fine-tuned on the sentiment analysis task.

**Results**
----------
This model received an impressive accuracy of 98% on the test set using the Adamax optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss function.
